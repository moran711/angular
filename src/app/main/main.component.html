          The history of Futbol Club Barcelona goes from the football club's
          founding in 1899 and up to current time. FC Barcelona, also known
          simply as Barcelona and familiarly as Barça, is based in
          Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. The team was founded in 1899 by a
          group of Swiss, English and Spanish footballers led by Joan
          Gamper. The club played amateur football until 1910 in various
          regional competitions. In 1910, the club participated in their
          first of many European competitions, and has since amassed
          fourteen UEFA trophies and a sextuple. In 1928, Barcelona
          co-founded La Liga, the top-tier in Spanish football, along with a
          string of other clubs. As of 2020, Barcelona has never been
          relegated from La Liga, a record they share with Athletic Bilbao
          and arch-rival Real Madrid.

          The history of Barcelona has often been political. Though it was a
          club created and run by foreigners, Barcelona gradually became a
          club associated with Catalan values. In Spain's transition to
          autocracy in 1925, Catalonia became increasingly hostile towards
          the central government in Madrid. The hostility enhanced
          Barcelona's image as a focal point for Catalonism, and when
          Francisco Franco banned the use of the Catalan language, the
          stadium of Barcelona became one of the few places the people could
          express their dissatisfaction. The Spanish transition to democracy
          in 1978 has not dampened the club's image of Catalan pride. In the
          2000s – a period of sporting success in the club and an increased
          focus on Catalan players – club officials have openly called for
          Catalonia to become an independent state.
